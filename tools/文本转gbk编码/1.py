s="Hello everyone, I am Gilbert. Everyone thought that I was killed, but actually I survived. Now that I have no cash with me and Iâ€™m trapped in another country. I can't contact Violet now. She must be desperate to see me and I don't want her to cry for me. I need to pay 300 for the train, and 88 for the meal. Cash or battlenet point are both accepted. I don't play the Hearthstone, and I don't even know what is Rastakhan's Rumble."
